## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FliteAxis/TrueHour.git
cd TrueHour/infrastructure

cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d

# Access the application
open http://localhost:8181
```

The React frontend runs on `http://localhost:8181` and the backend API on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option 2: Development Mode

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (separate terminal)

## 💾 Backup & Restore

### Backup

```bash
# Database backup
docker exec infrastructure-db-1 pg_dump -U truehour truehour > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Or use CSV exports from the Reports page
```

### Restore

```bash
# Restore from SQL dump
cat backup_20251225.sql | docker exec -i infrastructure-db-1 psql -U truehour truehour

# Or re-import ForeFlight CSV
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Frontend won't load

```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View frontend logs
docker-compose logs frontend

# Rebuild frontend
docker-compose up -d --build frontend
```

### Backend API errors

```bash
# View backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Check database connection
docker exec -it infrastructure-db-1 psql -U truehour truehour

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Database issues

```bash
# Check database is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# View database logs
docker-compose logs db

# Reset database (⚠️ destroys all data)
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### Port conflicts

```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
lsof -i :8000  # Backend
lsof -i :5432  # Database

# Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
```
