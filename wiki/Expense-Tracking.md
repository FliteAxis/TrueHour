## Overview

TrueHour's expense tracking system allows you to record aviation expenses and link them to budget cards. This enables you to answer questions
like "What did I spend this month?" and "Am I on track with my budget?"

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Your First Expense

   - **Amount:** Dollar amount
   - **Date:** When the expense occurred
   - **Description:** Optional details
   - **Vendor:** Optional (e.g., "Blue Sky Flight Club")
4. Click **"Save Expense"**

### 2. Link Expense to Budget Card

1. Find your expense in the list
2. Click the **🔗** (link) icon
3. Select a budget card from the dropdown
4. Enter amount to link (defaults to full expense amount)
5. Click **"Link to Budget Card"**

The budget card's **Actual** amount updates immediately!

### 3. Check Budget Status

## Use Cases

### After a Flight

**Track Rental + Instructor:**
```
1. Add expense: "Rental N12345" - $225 (1.5 hours @ $150/hr)

3. Add expense: "CFI lesson" - $90 (1.5 hours @ $60/hr)
4. Link to "Training" budget card
```

Your Training budget card now shows $315 actual spending.

### Fixed Monthly Costs

**Track Club Membership:**
```
1. Add expense: "Blue Sky Flight Club" - $250
2. Check "Recurring" → Select "Monthly"
3. Link to "Administrative" budget card

### Splitting Expenses

**Flight with Mixed Purpose:**

aircraft_id         INT (nullable, FK to aircraft)
category            TEXT NOT NULL
subcategory         TEXT
description         TEXT
amount              DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
date                DATE NOT NULL
is_recurring        BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
recurrence_interval TEXT (monthly, quarterly, annual)
recurrence_end_date DATE
vendor              TEXT

## Data Flow

### Creating an Expense

```
User fills form → ExpenseManager.saveExpense()
    ↓
POST /api/expenses
    ↓
postgres_db.create_expense()
    ↓
INSERT INTO expenses
    ↓
Returns created expense
    ↓
Reload expense list
    ↓
Trigger auto-save
```

### Linking Expense to Budget

```
User clicks 🔗 → ExpenseManager.linkToBudget()
    ↓
GET /api/expense-budget-links/expense/{id}
    ↓
Show modal with budget card selector
    ↓
POST /api/expense-budget-links
    ↓
Validates: expense exists, budget exists, amount ≤ expense amount
    ↓
INSERT INTO expense_budget_links
    ↓
Budget card query recalculates actual_amount:
  SELECT bc.*, COALESCE(SUM(ebl.amount), 0) as actual_amount
  FROM budget_cards bc
  LEFT JOIN expense_budget_links ebl ON bc.id = ebl.budget_card_id
    ↓
Reload budget cards (actual_amount updated)
```

## Frontend Components

The expense UI is implemented as React components in
`frontend-react/src/features/expenses/`:

- **ExpensesView.tsx** - Main expense list with filtering
- **CreateExpenseModal.tsx** - Create new expenses
- **EditExpenseModal.tsx** - Edit existing expenses
- **ExpensesList.tsx** - Expense table with sorting and grouping

Budget card linking is handled via the budget card detail views in
`frontend-react/src/features/budget/`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my expense"
- Check month filter (might be filtering it out)
- Check category filter
- Try "All Months" + "All Categories"

### "Budget card not updating"
- Make sure you **linked** the expense (click 🔗)
- Creating an expense doesn't auto-link it
- Must explicitly select budget card(s)

### "Can't link to budget"
- Create a budget card first
- Ensure budget card status is "active"

### "Link amount exceeds expense"
- Total linked amounts can't exceed expense amount
- Check existing links first
- Remove links if needed

## What's Next

### Priority 2: Budget Dashboard (4-6 hours)
- Month-over-month comparison charts
- Spending trends visualization
- Export to CSV for tax purposes
- Category breakdown pie charts

### Priority 3: Training Goals Integration (4-6 hours)
- Link budget cards to certification goals
- Show hours progress vs budget burn rate
- Calculate cost per hour
- Answer: "Can I afford to finish my rating?"

## Key Files

### Backend

- `backend/app/routers/expenses.py` - Expense CRUD endpoints
- `backend/app/routers/expense_budget_links.py` - Budget linking endpoints
- `backend/app/routers/budget_cards.py` - Budget card endpoints

### Frontend

- `frontend-react/src/features/expenses/` - Expense UI components
- `frontend-react/src/features/budget/` - Budget card UI components
- `frontend-react/src/store/expenseStore.ts` - Zustand state management
- Budget cards query already calculates actual_amount

---

## Performance Notes

- Budget cards use LEFT JOIN to calculate actual_amount in SQL
- No N+1 queries
- Efficient single-query loading
- Indexes on expense_date and category for fast filtering

## Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints ensure expense and budget exist before linking
- Unique constraint on (expense_id, budget_card_id) prevents duplicates
- Cascade delete: removing expense removes all its links automatically
